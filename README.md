# hello-world
New to github and going through tutorial
Hi GitHub Users.

J here.  I am here just learning how this works to see how useful this will be with additional projects that I may have.  I am new to this so please be patient but I will try to get the hang of this.  In the meantime I am open for any suggestions.
